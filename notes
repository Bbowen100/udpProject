Things to note:
- Added a small delay in sendPacket to avoid overwhelming the network.

- Work on retry logic that incorperates an ack signal aswell as exponential retry

- Update udp server to handle different requests in dedicated thread

- Look into using a streaming file format instead of wav and what type of audio player that would require

- Look into creating web socket server in cpp to connect to a browser client

- Stream audio from web socket server to the browser
