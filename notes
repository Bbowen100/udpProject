Things to note:
- Added a small delay in sendPacket to avoid overwhelming the network.

- Work on retry logic that incorperates an ack signal aswell as exponential retry

- Update udp server to handle different requests in dedicated thread

- Look into using a streaming file format instead of wav and what type of audio player that would require

- Look into creating web socket server in cpp to connect to a browser client (completed)

- Stream audio from web socket server to the browser (completed)

- Add REST endpoints to web socket server for 
    <!-- what other metrics should I add -->

To make your audio relay server project more technical and advanced, 
consider adding features such as 
- adaptive bitrate streaming for optimizing audio quality across different network conditions, 
- real-time audio transcoding with support for multiple audio codecs and formats, 
- and implementing load balancing to handle multiple connections efficiently. 
You can also enhance your MCP integration by optimizing the 
- data flow to ensure agents only fetch essential data fields, improving response times and reducing 
resource usage. 
- Integrating sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems for server and network health, 
- as well as automated anomaly detection and self-healing capabilities, will also increase technical robustness.

Moreover, incorporating AI-driven features like 
- predictive analytics for traffic and quality management, 
- and implementing security protocols for encryption and authentication in real-time communication, 
can make your project substantially more technical and production-ready. You might also explore the 
- use of advanced protocols such as WebRTC for low-latency streaming, 
- and containerization or orchestration technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for scalable deployment.
